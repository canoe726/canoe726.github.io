Markdown GitBlog provides a fully made blog page, a set of reusable React components that create website.

*Looking for demo?* üëâ <a href="https://blog.this-is-for-developer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Demo</a>


## üåü Features

- Ease of Making Blog Post : Before you start your own blog, only need to do just create a `.md` file in the `/posts/about` and `/posts/post` directories.
- Optimized for SEO : With Next.js's `SSG (Static Site Generation)` function and appropriate meta tag implementation for each page, you don't have to spend a lot of time on `SEO (Search Engine Optimization)`.
- Keep your Blog Up to Date : If you pull and push on the `master` branch after writing an article, you can keep your blog up to date by using `Git Actions` CI/CD.
